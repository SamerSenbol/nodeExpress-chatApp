**NODE-EXPRESS-CHAT-APP**

This is my first chatt app I have created by: **websocket**.
You should write (Node server) in the terminal to run the app.
In the Terminal you will get **server running** message and you will be able to see how many connection do you have.
You will find the app in the **localhost3000** port.
If you write **(/happy)** in the chat app input field you will have an happy man in the chat message area.
