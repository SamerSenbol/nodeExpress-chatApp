**NODE-EXPRESS-CHAT-APP**

I made this app just for practicing **node express framework and websocket protocol**

I've done it by folowing a video from **traversy media youtube channel** link:

**For starting the app:**

1- First of all you need to install the npm by: **npm i**.

2- Then you should write **Node server** in the terminal to run the app.

3- On port **http://localhost:3000/** you could run the app. 

**Note:**

In the Terminal you will get **server running** message and you will be able to see how many connection do you have.

When you enter name in the field and login you would be see that you have 1 connection in the terminal,
so you need to open another page on the same port and enter a new name to start chatting butween those those two users,

so when send a message from each of them it would be show for both of them,

and if you write **/happy** in the chat app input field you will have an happy man in both chat message area.
